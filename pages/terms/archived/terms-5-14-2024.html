                    Pricing details are provided to the Customer via email or other written form. By signing up with Cams Services, the Customer acknowledges and accepts the stated pricing. Customers will not be charged unless the service has been completed.
                    <br><br>
                    In the event of a price increase, Cams Services will provide written notification to the customer at least thirty (30) days prior to the new pricing taking effect. If there is an increase in the service price, the customer has the option to cancel the service within thirty (30) days of receiving the notification without incurring any cancellation fees or penalties.

The contract will automatically renew on January 1st for an additional year unless the Customer provides at least thirty (30) days’ advance written notice via email, expressing the intent to terminate services.

                    <br><br>
                    <b class="title">Nonpayment:</b>
                    <br><br>
